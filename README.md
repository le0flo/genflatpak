# dmenu X flatpak

This bash script generates executable links for every flatpak app and puts it in /usr/bin
This comes with a deleter also, that deletes every file previously generated, to keep things clean.

### Generating

Execute the script without arguments

### Deleting

Just put anythings you want as an argument, that will trigger the delete function

### Warning

Make sure that you chmod +x the file before trying to run it
